                In the grand scheme of the universe, our lives are but a fleeting moment. 
                A hundred years from now, we will all be dust, our stories forgotten, our struggles erased. 
                But does that make our lives meaningless? Or does it make them all the more precious?
            </p>
            <p>
                Every breath we take, every decision we make, shapes the world in ways we may never fully understand. 
                Even if our names are lost to time, the ripples of our actions will continue to echo through the ages.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what will you do with your time? Will you chase after fleeting pleasures, or will you strive to leave a lasting impact? 
                The choice is yours, but remember: in the end, we all return to the same dust.
